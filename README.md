 ☆ <b>My First Jquery Code:</b> <p>This is the first code I write, <p>basing with jquery basics <i>.click, .toggleClass(), .hide()    and .show().</i><p> I can't believe I just started the script with $(".btn-menu").click(function(){ <p>and tried a few          things I've learned so far and actually wrote my own very first jquery code. <a href="https://bishonenlover.github.io/todorokiscute/jqcode" target="_blank">view</a>
   
 ☆ <b>A facebook inspired post style:</b> <p>This was really cool and funny to made. <p>
