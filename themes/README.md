<h1>My Fave Old Themes</h1>
<blockquote> These are the themes I've used in many of my different blogs, <p>and decided to make previews to idk, keep seeying them lol</blockquote>
☆ <b>Kuroshitsuji</b> <p>
 A theme I used in my Anime Reviews blog back in 2015. <p>It's not fluid or responsive, since it was made with PSD. <a href="https://bishonenlover.github.io/todorokiscute/themes/kuroshitsuji.html">view</a>

☆ <b>Purple and Pink</b><p>
One of my faves themes of my anime reviews blog. <p>It's quite simple but very colorful and charming. <a href="https://bishonenlover.github.io/todorokiscute/themes/roxo-rosa-preferido.html">view</a>

☆ <b>Gray and Purple</b><p>
Actually not responsive at all. But I played a lot with jquery in this, <p>to make sticky both sidebar and menu. <a href="https://bishonenlover.github.io/todorokiscute/themes/151218.html">view</a>

☆ <b>PurplePink Layout</b><p>
 This would be the new layout of my anime reviews blog, but I ended up not using. It's not a theme per se, just a demo.<a href="https://bishonenlover.github.io/todorokiscute/themes/purplepink-layout.html">view</a>
